# Unanimos (Unani) Awareness App

## **Preface**

The feeling of disappointment that envelops someone without friends, cut off from vital information, and the initial depression that settles as a result of repetitive failure is truly overwhelming. In Nigeria, where innovation is often shunned and looked down upon, this very attitude can foster complacency, leading to a perpetual cycle of failure and a sense of incompleteness, especially in our academics.

The root cause of our academic struggles often lies not in our failure to attend classes, but rather in our unawareness of where our problems truly lie. It's the ignorance that plagues us. The cure to ignorance, as they say, is awareness. And what better way to become aware than through timely reminders or nudges? We all need that little push in life, a call to action. Yet, the feeling of falling behind, of being left behind, is nothing short of infuriating.

Enter Unani, a platform that aims to bridge the gap by informing and nudging us about what we need to do to excel academically. It's not merely about changing light bulbs; it's about servicing the electricity source itself. Unani delves deep into the roots of the problem. While the student receives direction, it doesn't guarantee immediate solutions. Dedication and personal initiative are essential; the decision to act must come from within.

Unani strives to empower students to take action independently, leading to a sense of accomplishment. Procrastination is a common ailment among university students, often triggered by the mere mention of stress. We instinctively flee from it. However, facing our challenges head-on is the only way to grow and succeed.

This is where **collaboration** comes in. We believe that by coming together and pooling our resources, knowledge, and skills, we can create solutions that address these challenges effectively. We need collaborators who are passionate about empowering students, who understand the importance of awareness and proactive action in academic success.

Unani is calling for collaborators who share our vision of creating a supportive and empowering academic environment. If you are passionate about making a difference in the lives of students and believe in the power of collaboration, we invite you to join us on this journey. Together, we can pave the way for a brighter future for students in Nigeria and beyond.

We will begin with the simplest step to take: **Notification of Student's Lecture times** based on their existing timetable.
